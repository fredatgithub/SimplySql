Each Provider will provide its open "Open-*Connection" cmdlet...
    Open-OracleConnection, Open-SqlConnection, Open-SQLiteConnection, Open-PostGreConnection, Open-MySqlConnection

    This will simply providing help for the provider as well as writing the providers.
    It will add some redunant code between the Open-*Connection cmdlets, but little enough to be a problem.

Providers now simply need to have a config.ps1 in their folder, that file will control setting up the provider and exporting its cmdlet.
    If the provider requires adding types, then the provider class will need to be in a separate file (provider.ps1) and config.ps1 will need to dotsource
    it after it has added the required types.

Always roll version (minor) forward by 1 when updating provider nuget packages.

TODO:
+ ProviderBase in .NET
+ DataReaderToPSObject in .NET
+ PSObjectDataReader in .NET
    - update sqlBulkcopy to take objects directly / andor to take datareader directly?
    - or create full fleged provider for objects? (maybe using datatable as backend?)
+ Allow invoke-SqlQuery/SqlUpdate to take objects as input (translate to parameters) -- single or multiple objects? (probably single only)
